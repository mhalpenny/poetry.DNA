//--VARIABLES----------------------------
//Declares all global variables and arrays that will be used across the sketch

var arrayFromPhp = [];
var lineArrayBuffer = [];
var lineArray = [];
var mutationArray = [];

//--PRELOAD------------------------------
//Before loading the page this function will execute, this ensures all assets...
//are present before executing any additonal functions

function preload() {
  //recieves JSON data from previous run (formatting, words, mutations, etc.)
  receiveData();
  //load training poems for markov generation
  train = loadStrings('assets/poems.txt');
  //font to be displayed for poem
  myFont = loadFont('assets/PitchTest-Regular.otf');
}



//--SETUP--------------------------------
//Initial functions and setup before execution

function setup() {

  //creates a canvas variable that allows positioning inside HTML
  var cnv = createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight*0.8);
  //alocate the canavs within the <div> element called "canvas"
  cnv.parent('canvas');
  //draw the background black with transparency (the gif is below embedded in the CSS)
  // background(0, 0, 0, 40);

  //slow framrate to allow JSON fetching to keep up on slow servers
  frameRate(60);
  //instantiate RiTa lexicon, loads an array of English language words
  //lexicon will be called during mutations for word substitutions

  //create markov object for sentence generation
  //arguement represents n-grades which will change accuracy/randomness
  markovSen = new RiMarkov(4);
  //create markov object for word replacement

  //the training text to use in markov chains is loaded in the markov objects here
  markovSen.loadText(train.join(' '));
  markovWor.loadText(train.join(' '));

  //a boolean used to set initial line count, because of the structure of the functions...
  //line count updating (additons, deletions) can interefere with the inital count...
  //this boolean controls when the initial count is used for summation
  lineBool = false;
}

//--DRAW----------------------------------
//Draw will actually only loop through once in this code, the difference between it and...
//setup is similar to preload(), setup loads assets through RiTa fucntions, the reason for...
//this is to limit the mutations to one round per visit, which work more efficiently once the training is properly analyzed.

  textFont(myFont);
  //set text size
  textSize(12);
  //set text alignment
  textAlign(CENTER);
  //text box draw mode

  //timer function ensures the data is loaded before executing the code
  //usually this is done inside preload() but there are some issues using
  //custom functions within preload()in p5.js

// The analysis function reads in string data from arrayfromPhp (see RetrieveData())

  //arrayFromPhp into an array where each line is stored as a string

      //better with a singular string variable.
      var sTemp = lineArray[j];
      //if the string is not empty, which usually means a break line...
      //create a RiTa string. These string functions allow processing by further RiTa functions.
